## Description
A user script that enables audio notifications in Campfire when a message is
received from a specific user or when it contains a specific word.

## Usage
After installing the script, specify the URL for the audio file to play in
the 'Audio URL' field.  To play the audio file when a certain word is
mentioned, specify that word in the 'Message Trigger' field.  To play the
audio file when a specific user chats a message, specify that user's name
in the 'User Trigger' field. 

## Thanks
Thanks to Tim Harper and his great Growl Notifications plugin, from which this plugin is based.
